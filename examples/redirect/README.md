# Redirect

Example where a page distribute users randomly by different pages, one page per variant.

* [Redirect example](redirect.html) - Links should point to this page only.
* [Variant 0](variant-0.html) - Usually the "original", although you can also use JavaScript to modify it, for example to help tracking.
* [Variant 1](variant-1.html) - A variant example.
