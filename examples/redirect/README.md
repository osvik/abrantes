# Redirect

Example where a page distribute users randomly by different pages, one page per variant.

* [Redirect example](redirect.html) - Links should point to this page only.
* [Variant 0](variant-0.html) - Usually the "original", although you can also use JavaScript to modify it, for example to help tracking.
* [Variant 1](variant-1.html) - A variant example.

Redirects experiment are less reliable because it's likely that someone will link to one of the variants, intead of linking to the redirect page. However some experiments are too complex to do it any other way.
