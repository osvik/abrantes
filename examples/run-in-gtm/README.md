# Run Abrantes inside Google Tag Manager

You can run an Abrantes experiment inside a Google Tag Manager custom HTML tag.

* [page.html](page.html) - Example HTML page with Google Tag Manager and an experiment.
* [tag.html](tag.html) - An example of a custom HTML tag.

Please note that performance may be impacted when compared with other methods. Use only if you don't have other ways of using Abrantes, like for example, in pages that do not allow custom html but allow Google Tag Manager.
