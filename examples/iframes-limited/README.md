# Iframe limited JavaScript

In this example we see how to make an experiment with Abrantes when you have restrictions on the JavaScript you can put inside the iframe. Use when you can add JavaScript for the conversion event only.

* [parent.html](parent.html) - The experiment variants are managed from here. Each variant loads a different iFrame, assuming you can't pass information to the iframe.
