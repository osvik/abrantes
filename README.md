# Abrantes

Abrantes is a JavaScript browser library to create advanced AB tests in websites. It's also a Portuguese city.

## With Abrantes you can

- Have complete control in the tests and integration with Google Analytics 4.
- Create multivariate and page redirect tests that can run for as long as you want. Have simultaneous tests for any number of users and page views. Abrantes has no limit on the number of tests you can run, but ideally you should use a GA4 custom dimension for each test.  Thatâ€™s 50 event scoped dimensions and 25 user dimensions. You can delete dimensions after the tests.
- Use a tool that is as private as it can be. It doesn't share information with **new** third party companies, just GA4.
- Modify it. Abrantes is open source and it's a proof of concept that I may use to fit my needs.
- Modify it for a specific test! Yes, you can modify how Abrantes works for a specific test while all the other tests can continue to work with the defaults.
